                <span class="secondTextColor itemTitle">Honesty</span><br>
                I am very honest. I don't like to lie. If someone asks me for an
                opinion on their work I always have an honest answer.

                <span class="secondTextColor itemTitle">Too precise</span><br>
                Being very precise can be a good thing, but it is also 
                a weakness, because it can lead to a slow worker.

                <span class="secondTextColor itemTitle">Self-motivation</span><br>
                Because I have self motivation I have the willpower to keep doing 
                my work without giving up no matter how hard the task is.

                <span class="secondTextColor itemTitle">Shyness</span><br>
                I can be shy talking to new people, but not for a 
                long time. When I get to know them my shyness goes away.

                <span class="secondTextColor itemTitle">Patience</span><br>
                Being patient is one of the most important strenghts.
                It is needed in many situations. For example I can remain calm 
                when I have bugs.

                <span class="secondTextColor itemTitle">Disorganized</span><br>
                This weakness doesn't happen too often, but it does happen 
                when i have many files and I am being too lazy they can 
                get unorginazed very quickly.
